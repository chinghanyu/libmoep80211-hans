Moep80211 injection library
===========================

The moep80211 injection library allows for frame injection on monitor mode
devices with per-frame radiotap options such as TX rate / MCS index and RTS/CTS
protection. Most of these options require small patches of the mac80211
susbsystem and device specific drivers.


Installation
------------

To install moep80211 you can use the following commands:

	./configure
	make
	make install

See ./configure --help for details on the available parameters. For example you
can use --prefix=DIR to specify the installation prefix or --enable-examples to
build the example programs.

If you use a git checkout you must run the following commands first:

	apt-get install autoconf-archive automake autoconf autoconf-archive autotools-dev libnl-3-dev libnl-genl-3-dev libnl-route-3-dev libtool pkg-config
	autoreconf -fi

A lot of functionality of the moep80211 library requires some patches to the
mac80211 subsystem. This version is known to work with compat-drivers-3.9-rc2-2,
other versions might work as well but are not tested. Use the following commands
to install a patched version of the drivers.

	tar -xjf compat-drivers-3.9-rc2-2.tar.bz2
	cd compat-drivers-3.9-rc2-2
	patch -p1 < ../patches/radiotap-bitrate_mcs_rtscts.compat-drivers-3.9-rc2-2.patch
	patch -p1 < ../patches/radiotap-hole18_vht.compat-drivers-3.9-rc2-2.patch

	(additional device specific patches might be nescessary, see the patches
	directory for available patches)

	make
	make install


Documentation
-------------

See moep80211(3) and other manual pages for a detailed description of the
functionality.
